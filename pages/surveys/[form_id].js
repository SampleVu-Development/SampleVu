import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

/*
* TODO: Taster Survey View
* Refer to dynamic routing documentation here:
* https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes
*
* Should be virtually identical to Edit View, but with the following differences:
* - no editable fields except response
* - no create/delete
* - submit button instead of save button
* - no navbar
*
* Also may want to use server-side rendering or generation (SSR/SSG),
* so use getServerSideProps or getStaticProps
